control_panel
=============

Arduino compatible/ ChipKit project driving an impressive looking but useless control panel.

This is frivolous, but there's no reason why it shouldn't be sensible. I'm wiring together a control panel - a collection of buttons and switches and lights and displays. The controls may have some effect on the outputs, some may be random.

This should allow a way to add new controls or outputs into the system easily, and change behaviors without having to dig through code a crazy amount.
